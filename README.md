# Repository-for-the-Characterization-of-Jupiter-Equatorial-Zone-isturbance
Antuñano et al. (2020) used ground-based mid-infrared (8-20 µm) data acquired by VISIR instrument mounted on the VLT in Chile, COMICS instrument mounted on the Subaru telescope on Maunakea (Hawai'i) and MIRSI instrument mounted on the IRTF (Maunakea) between 2005 and 2008 to characterize the variability of tropospheric temperature and aerosol opacity during the 2006-2007 Equatorial Zone disturbance. 

This repository contains IRTF/MIRSI images captured at 8.6 µm, 13.0 µm and 17.6 µm between 2006-2008, used in Antuñano et al. (2020) to investigate the temporal variability of the brightness temperatures of the Equatorial Zone at these wavelengths. These images are already reduced and subtraction of the sky emission, flat-fielding and radiometric calibration (to match the Cassini CIRS observations) have been previously performed.
